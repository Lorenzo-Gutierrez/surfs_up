Weather analysis using SQLite files

## Purpose
This is an analysis of weather data for Oahu, Hawaii. The purpose is to use the weather data to identify whether this would be a good location to open a surf and ice cream shop. For the final challenge, we were asked to compare June and December temperatures.

## Results
There are three main differences between June and December temperatures
-Average temperatures: 74.94 in June vs 71.04 in December
-Lowest temperatures: 64 in June vs 56 in December
-Highest temperatures: 85 in June vs 83 in December

## Summary
Based on these results alone, it doesn't look like temperature would be an issue. We should look at a day by day analysis for December to determine if the lowest temperatures all occur within a certain date range, towards the end of the month for example. We should also pull precipitation data to help in our decision making.
